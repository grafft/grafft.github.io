A particular example of that domain is visuallinguistic tasks, such as Visual Question Answering. The progress of modern machine learning systems is determined, among other things, by the data on which these systems are trained. Most modern visual question answering datasets contain limited type questions that can be answered either by directly accessing the image itself or by using external data. At the same time, insufficient attention is paid to the issues of social interactions between people, which limits the scope of visual question answering systems. In this paper, we propose criteria by which images suitable for social interaction visual question answering can be selected for composing such questions, based on psychological research. We believe this should serve the progress of visual question answering systems.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.16362.pdf},
	abstract = {Model predictive control ({MPC}) may provide local motion planning for mobile robotic platforms. The challenging aspect is the analytic representation of collision cost for the case when both the obstacle map and robot footprint are arbitrary. We propose a Neural Potential Field: a neural network model that returns a differentiable collision cost based on robot pose, obstacle map, and robot footprint. The differentiability of our model allows its usage within the {MPC} solver. It is computationally hard to solve problems with a very high number of parameters. Therefore, our architecture includes neural image encoders, which transform obstacle maps and robot footprints into embeddings, which reduce problem dimensionality by two orders of magnitude. The reference data for network training are generated based on algorithmic calculation of a signed distance function. Comparative experiments showed that the proposed approach is comparable with existing local planners: it provides trajectories with outperforming smoothness, comparable path length, and safe distance from obstacles. Experiment on Husky {UGV} mobile robot showed that our approach allows real-time and safe local planning. The code for our approach is presented at https://github.com/cog-isa/{NPField} together with demo video.},

In typical {MAPF} scenarios, the graph and the agents’ starting and ending vertices are known beforehand, allowing the use of centralized planning algorithms. However, in this study, we focus on the decentralized {MAPF} setting, where the agents may observe the other agents only locally and are restricted in communications with each other. Specifically, we investigate the lifelong variant of {MAPF}, where new goals are continually assigned to the agents upon completion of previous ones. Drawing inspiration from the successful {AlphaZero} approach, we propose a decentralized multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search ({MCTS}) method for {MAPF} tasks. Our approach utilizes the agent’s observations to recreate the intrinsic Markov decision process, which is then used for planning with a tailored for multi-agent tasks version of neural {MCTS}.

	abstract = {Multi-agent Pathfinding ({MAPF}) problem generally asks to find a set of conflict-free paths for a set of agents confined to a graph and is typically solved in a centralized fashion. Conversely, in this work, we investigate the decentralized {MAPF} setting, when the central controller that possesses all the information on the agents’ locations and goals is absent and the agents have to sequentially decide the actions on their own without having access to the full state of the environment. We focus on the practically important lifelong variant of {MAPF}, which involves continuously assigning new goals to the agents upon arrival to the previous ones. To address this complex problem, we propose a method that integrates two complementary approaches: planning with heuristic search and reinforcement learning through policy optimization. Planning is utilized to construct and re-plan individual paths. We enhance our planning algorithm with a dedicated technique tailored to avoid congestion and increase the throughput of the system. We employ reinforcement learning to discover the collision avoidance policies that effectively guide the agents along the paths. The policy is implemented as a neural network and is effectively trained without any reward-shaping or external guidance. We evaluate our method on a wide range of setups comparing it to the state-of-the-art solvers. The results show that our method consistently outperforms the learnable competitors, showing higher throughput and better ability to generalize to the maps that were unseen at the training stage. Moreover our solver outperforms a rulebased one in terms of throughput and is an order of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art search-based solver.

	abstract = {Object-centric architectures usually apply a differentiable module to the entire
feature map to decompose it into sets of entity representations called slots. Some
of these methods structurally resemble clustering algorithms, where the cluster’s
center in latent space serves as a slot representation. Slot Attention is an example
of such a method, acting as a learnable analog of the soft k-means algorithm.
Our work employs a learnable clustering method based on the Gaussian Mixture
Model. Unlike other approaches, we represent slots not only as centers of clusters
but also incorporate information about the distance between clusters and assigned
vectors, leading to more expressive slot representations. Our experiments demonstrate
that using this approach instead of Slot Attention improves performance in
object-centric scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art results in the set property prediction
task.},

In our work, we explore both of these aspects: the deep learning application to improve the efficiency of waste recognition on recycling plant’s conveyor, as well as carbon dioxide emission from the computing devices used in this process. To conduct research, we developed an unique open {WaRP} dataset that demonstrates the best diversity among similar industrial datasets and contains more than 10,000 images with 28 different types of recyclable goods (bottles, glasses, card boards, cans, detergents, and canisters). Objects can overlap, be in poor lighting conditions, or significantly distorted. On the {WaRP} dataset, we study training and evaluation of cutting-edge deep neural networks for detection, classification and segmentation tasks. Additionally, we developed a hierarchical neural network approach called H-{YC} with weakly supervised waste segmentation. It provided a notable increase in the detection quality and made it possible to segment images, learning only having class labels, not their masks. Both the suggested hierarchical approach and the {WaRP} dataset have shown great industrial application potential.},

One of the most important components of this task is the accurate semantic representation of the scene, which is needed to determine and reach a goal object. This paper introduces a new representation of a scene semantic map formed during the embodied agent interaction with the indoor environment. It is based on a neural network method that adjusts the weights of the segmentation model with backpropagation of the predicted fusion loss values during inference on a regular (backward) or delayed (forward) image sequence. We implement this representation into a full-fledged navigation approach called {SkillTron}. The method can select robot skills from end-to-end policies based on reinforcement learning and classic map-based planning methods. The proposed approach makes it possible to form both intermediate goals for robot exploration and the final goal for object navigation. We conduct intensive experiments with the proposed approach in the Habitat environment, demonstrating its significant superiority over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of navigation quality metrics.

We test our algorithm in the hard-exploration Prince of Persia game, without rewards and domain knowledge.

These results are commonly achieved at the expense of huge computational costs and require an incredible number of episodes of interactions between the agent and the environment. Hierarchical methods and expert demonstrations are among the most promising approaches to improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning methods. In this paper, we propose a combination of methods that allow the agent to use low-quality demonstrations in complex vision-based environments with multiple related goals. Our Forgetful Experience Replay ({ForgER}) algorithm effectively handles expert data errors and reduces quality losses when adapting the action space and states representation to the agent’s capabilities. The proposed goal-oriented replay buffer structure allows the agent to automatically highlight sub-goals for solving complex hierarchical tasks in demonstrations. Our method has a high degree of versatility and can be integrated into various off-policy methods. The {ForgER} surpasses the existing state-of-the-art {RL} methods using expert demonstrations in complex environments. The solution based on our algorithm beats other solutions for the famous {MineRL} competition and allows the agent to demonstrate the behavior at the expert level.},

Among these, the design of control systems capable of automating a wide range of {UAV} activities is one of the most actively explored and evolving. Currently, researchers and developers are interested in designing control systems that can be referred to as intelligent, e.g. the systems which are suited to solve such tasks as planning, goal prioritization, coalition formation etc. and thus guarantee high levels of {UAV} autonomy. One of the principal problems in intelligent control system design is tying together various methods and models traditionally used in robotics and aimed at solving such tasks as dynamics modelling, control signal genera- tion, location and mapping, path planning etc. with the methods of behaviour modelling and planning which are thoroughly studied in cognitive science. Our work is aimed at solving this problem. We propose layered architecture — {STRL} (strategic, tactical, reactive, layered) — of the control system that au- tomates the behaviour generation using a cognitive approach while taking into account complex dynamics and kinematics of the control object ({UAV}).We use a special type of knowledge representation — sign world model — that is based on the psychological activity theory to describe individual behaviour planning and coalition formation processes. We also propose path planning methodology which serves as the mediator between the high-level cognitive activities and the reactive control signals generation. To generate these signals we use a state-dependent Riccati equation and specific method for solving it. We believe that utilization of the proposed architecture will broaden the spectrum of tasks which can be solved by the {UAV}’s coalition automatically, as well as raise the autonomy level of each individual member of that coalition.},

	abstract = {The multi-modal tasks have started to play a significant role in the research on Artificial Intelligence. A particular example of that domain is visual-linguistic tasks, such as Visual Question Answering and its extension, Visual Dialog. In this paper, we concentrate on the Visual Dialog task and dataset. The task involves two agents. The first agent does not see an image and asks questions about the image content. The second agent sees this image and answers questions. The symbol grounding problem, or how symbols obtain their meanings, plays a crucial role in such tasks. We approach that problem from the semiotic point of view and propose the Vector Semiotic Architecture for Visual Dialog. The Vector Semiotic Architecture is a combination of the Sign-Based World Model and Vector Symbolic Architecture. The Sign-Based World Model represents agent knowledge on the high level of abstraction and allows uniform representation of different aspects of knowledge, forming a hierarchical representation of that knowledge in the form of a special kind of semantic network. The Vector Symbolic Architecture represents the computational level and allows to operate with symbols as with numerical vectors using simple element-wise operations. That combination enables grounding object representation from any level of abstraction to the sensory agent input.},

The {SBWM} architecture is a multigraph, called a semiotic network with special rules of activation spreading. In a semiotic network, there are four subgraphs that have specific properties and are composed of constituents of the main {SBWM} element – the sign. Such subgraphs are called causal networks on images, significances, personal meanings, and names. The semiotic network can be viewed as the memory of an intelligent agent. It is proposed to divide the agent’s memory in the {SBWM} architecture into a long-term memory consisting of signs-prototype, and a working memory consisting of signs-instance. The concept of elementary mental actions is introduced as an integral part of the reasoning process. Examples of such actions are provided. The performance of the proposed reasoning algorithm is considered by a model example.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm for hierarchical case-based behavior planning in a coalition of agents – {HierMAP}. The considered algorithm, in contrast to the well-known planners {HEART}, {PANDA}, and others, is intended primarily for use in multi-agent tasks. For this, the possibility of dynamically distributing agent roles with different functionalities was realized. The use of a psychologically plausible approach to the representation of the knowledge by agents using a semiotic network allows applying {HierMAP} in groups in which people participate as one of the actors. Thus, the algorithm allows us to represent solutions of collaborative problems, forming human- interpretable results at each planning step. Another advantage of the proposed method is the ability to save and reuse experience of planning – expansion in the field of case-based planning. Such extension makes it possible to consider information about the success/ failure of interaction with other members of the coalition. Presenting precedents as a special part of the agent’s memory (semantic network on meanings) allows to significantly reduce the planning time for a similar class of tasks. The paper deals with smart relocation tasks in the environment. A comparison is made with the main hierarchical planners widely used at present.},

The description is based on the concept of sign, which is widely used in psychology and, in particular, in the cultural-historical theory by Vygotsky, in which sign is interpreted informally. In this paper, we elaborate upon the concept of sign, consider mechanisms of sign formation, and some self-organization on the set of signs. Due to the work of self-organization mechanisms, a new method for the representation of the world model of an actor appears. The concept of semiotic network is introduced that is used for the examination of the actor’s world models. Models of some functions indicated above are constructed. The second part of the paper is devoted to functions of self-consciousness and to the application of the constructed models for designing plans and constructing new architectures of intelligent agents that are able, in particular, to distribute roles in coalitions.},

Examples of such criteria are a guarantee of finding optimal solu- tions, high-speed operation, the possibility of operation in partially observable environments, etc. This paper provides a survey of modern methods for multi-agent path finding. Special attention is given to various settings of the problem. The differences and between trainable and nontrainable solution methods and their applicability are discussed.

One of the promising approaches to solve it is decomposing the problem into the smaller sub-problems and combining the local solutions into the global one. The crux of any planning method for non- holonomic robots is the generation of motion primitives that generates solutions to local planning sub-problems. In this work we introduce a novel learnable steering function (policy), which takes into account kinodynamic constraints of the robot and both static and dynamic obstacles. This policy is efficiently trained via the policy optimization. Empirically, we show that our steering function generalizes well to unseen problems. We then plug in the trained policy into the sampling-based and lattice-based planners, and evaluate the resultant {POLAMP} algorithm (Policy Optimization that Learns Adaptive Motion Primitives) in a range of challenging setups that involve a car-like robot operating in the obstacle-rich parking-lot en- vironments. We show that {POLAMP} is able to plan collision- free kinodynamic trajectories with success rates higher than 92\%, when 50 simultaneously moving obstacles populate the environment showing better performance than the state-of-the- art competitors.},

This work proposes a stochastic formulation of the pathfinding problem, assuming that obstacles of arbitrary shapes may appear and disappear at random moments of time. Moreover, we consider the case when the environment is only partially observable for an agent. We study and evaluate two orthogonal approaches to tackle the problem of reaching the goal under such conditions: planning and learning. Within planning, an agent constantly re-plans and upyears the path based on the history of the observations using a search-based planner. Within learning, an agent asynchronously learns to optimize a policy function using recurrent neural networks (we propose an original efficient, scalable approach). We carry on an extensive empirical evaluation of both approaches that show that the learning-based approach scales better to the increasing number of the unpredictably appearing/disappearing obstacles. At the same time, the planning-based one is preferable when the environment is close-to-the-deterministic ( i.e. , external disturbances are rare).

Recent works have shown significant achievements in the end-to-end reinforcement learning approach and modular systems. However, both approaches need a big step forward to be robust and practically applicable. To solve the problem of insufficient exploration of the scenes and make exploration more semantically meaningful, we extend standard task formulation and give the agent easily accessible landmarks in the form of the room locations and those types. The availability of landmarks allows the agent to build a hierarchical policy structure and achieve a success rate of 63\% on validation scenes in a photo- realistic Habitat simulator. In a hierarchy, a low level consists of separately trained {RL} skills and a high level deterministic policy, which decides which skill is needed at the moment. Also, in this paper, we show the possibility of transferring a trained policy to a real robot. After a bit of training on the reconstructed real scene, the robot shows up to 79\% {SPL} when solving the task of navigating to an arbitrary object.},

	abstract = {In this work we study the behavior of groups of autonomous vehicles, which are the part of the Internet {ofVehicles} systems. One of the challenging modes of operation of such systems is the case when the observability of each vehicle is limited and the global/local communication is unstable, e.g. in the crowded parking lots. In such scenarios the vehicles have to rely on the local observations and exhibit cooperative behavior to ensure safe and efficient trips. This type of problems can be abstracted to the so-called multi- agent pathfinding when a group of agents, confined to a graph, have to find collision-free paths to their goals (ideally, minimizing an objective function e.g. travel time). Widely used algorithms for solving this problem rely on the assumption that a central controller exists for which the full state of the environment (i.e. the agents current positions, their targets, configuration of the static obstacles etc.) is known and they cannot be straightforwardly be adapted to the partially-observable setups. To this end, we suggest a novel approach which is based on the decomposition of the problem into the two sub-tasks: reaching the goal and avoiding the collisions. To accomplish each of this task we utilize reinforcement learning methods such as Deep Monte Carlo Tree Search, Q-mixing networks, and policy gradients methods to design the policies that map the agents’ observations to actions. Next, we introduce the policy-mixing mechanism to end up with a single hybrid policy that allows each agent to exhibit both types of behavior – the individual one (reaching the goal) and the cooperative one (avoiding the collisions with other agents). We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation that shows that the suggested hybrid-policy outperforms standalone stat-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods for this kind of problems by a notable margin.},

  abstract = {World models facilitate sample-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) and, by design, can benefit from the multitask information. However, it is not used by typical model-based RL (MBRL) agents. We propose a data-centric approach to this problem. We build a controllable optimization process for MBRL agents that selectively prioritizes the data used by the model-based agent to improve its performance. We show how this can favor implicit task generalization in a custom environment based on MetaWorld with a parametric task variability. Furthermore, by bootstrapping the agent’s data, our method can boost the performance on unstable environments from DeepMind Control Suite. This is done without any additional data and architectural changes outperforming state-of-the-art visual model-based RL algorithms. Additionally, we frame the approach within the scope of methods that have unintentionally followed the controllable optimization process paradigm, filling the gap of the data-centric task-bootstrapping methods.},

	abstract = {We present a novel dataset named as HPointLoc, specially designed for exploring capabilities of visual place recognition in indoor environment and loop detection in simultaneous localization and mapping. The loop detection sub-task is especially relevant when a robot with an on-board RGB-D camera can drive past the same place (``Point") at different angles. The dataset is based on the popular Habitat simulator, in which it is possible to generate photorealistic indoor scenes using both own sensor data and open datasets, such as Matterport3D. To study the main stages of solving the place recognition problem on the HPointLoc dataset, we proposed a new modular approach named as PNTR. It first performs an image retrieval with the Patch-NetVLAD method, then extracts keypoints and matches them using R2D2, LoFTR or SuperPoint with SuperGlue, and finally performs a camera pose optimization step with TEASER++. Such a solution to the place recognition problem has not been previously studied in existing publications. The PNTR approach has shown the best quality metrics on the HPointLoc dataset and has a high potential for real use in localization systems for unmanned vehicles. The proposed dataset and framework are publicly available: https://github.com/metra4ok/HPointLoc.},

	abstract = {In recent years, Embodied AI has become one of the main topics in robotics. For the agent to operate in human-centric environments, it needs the ability to explore previously unseen areas and to navigate to objects that humans want the agent to interact with. This task, which can be formulated as ObjectGoal Navigation (ObjectNav), is the main focus of this work. To solve this challenging problem, we suggest a hybrid framework consisting of both not-learnable and learnable modules and a switcher between them—SkillFusion. The former are more accurate, while the latter are more robust to sensors’ noise. To mitigate the sim-to-real gap, which often arises with learnable methods, we suggest training them in such a way that they are less environment-dependent. As a result, our method showed top results in both the Habitat simulator and during the evaluations on a real robot. Video and code for our approach can be found on our website: https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/skill-fusion (accessed on 13 July 2023).},

	abstract = {Object-oriented models are expected to have better generalization abilities and operate on a more compact state representation. Recent studies have shown that using pre-trained object-centric representation learning models for state factorization in model-free algorithms improves the efficiency of policy learning. Approaches using object-factored world models to predict the environment dynamics have also shown their effectiveness in object-based grid-world environments. Following those works, we propose a novel object-oriented model-based value-based reinforcement learning algorithm Object Oriented Q-network (OOQN) employing an object-oriented decomposition of the world and state-value models. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the developed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art model-free policy gradient algorithms and model-based value-based algorithm with a monolithic world model in tasks where individual dynamics of the objects is similar.},
