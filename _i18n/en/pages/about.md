Currently, I lead a group for neuro-symbolic integration at the <a href='https://airi.net'>Artificial Intelligence Institute</a> (AIRI), engage in embodied artificial intelligence at the <a href='https://cogmodel.mipt.ru'>Cognitive Modeling Center</a> of the <a href='https://mipt.ru/english/'>Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology</a> (MIPT), and work on deep reinforcement learning at the <a href='https://www.frccsc.ru'>Federal Research Center "Computer Science and Control" of the Russian Academy of Sciences</a> (FRC CSC RAS). My current scientific interests are related to transformer models and structured world models in reinforcement learning, applying language models for behavior planning (including robotics platforms), multi-agent planning and learning, and indoor visual navigation.

At AIRI, my primary focus is on fundamental research for creating new neurosymbolic architectures for planning and learning. At MIPT, I lead applied activities and oversee commissioned research in robotics and control systems. Since 2019, I have been leading applied research in developing computer vision and planning systems for mobile robotics and unmanned vehicles commissioned by companies such as <a href='https://www.nkbvs.ru/?p=79'>NKB VS<a/>, <a href='https://integrant.ru'>Integrant</a>, <a href='https://www.huawei.com/en'>Huawei</a>, <a href='https://www.sberbank.com/promo/ecosystem/'>Sber</a>. Additionally, at MIPT, I am the head of the <a href='http://rairi.ru/wiki/index.php/Магистерская_программа_МТИИ'>master's program in artificial intelligence</a>, which is one of the most sought-after non-industrial programs in the <a href='https://mipt.ru/education/departments/fpmi/'>Phystech School of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science</a> (FPMI). At FRC CSC RAS, I lead the department of <a href='https://rairi.frccsc.ru/en/structure/1'>Dynamic Intelligent Systems and Cognitive Research</a> and develop various approaches in the field of reinforcement learning.

**Brief Biography:** In 2005, I graduated from the <a href='https://sesc.nsu.ru/'>physics and mathematics school</a> at <a href='https://www.nsu.ru'>Novosibirsk State University</a> (NSU), and later pursued a bachelor's degree in the Faculty of Physics at the same university, specializing in physical-technical informatics. I completed my master's degree in applied mathematics and physics at MIPT, <a href='https://intsystems.github.io'>Department of Intelligent Systems</a> (basic department of the <a href='http://www.ccas.ru'>Computing Center of RAS</a>). I conducted my doctoral dissertation at the <a href='http://www.isa.ru'>Institute for System Analysis of RAS</a> under the guidance of <a href='https://cogmodel.mipt.ru/gos-bio'>G.S. Osipov</a> (topic _Research of methods, development of models, and algorithms for forming elements of the sign representation of the subject's world model_). Since 2019, I have been leading the scientific and educational <a href='https://cogmodel.mipt.ru'>Center for Cognitive Modeling</a> at MIPT and the <a href='http://rairi.ru/wiki/index.php/Магистерская_программа_МТИИ'>master's program _Methods and Technologies of Artificial Intelligence_</a> at FPMI.

**Honors and Awards:** In 2017, I became a laureate of the <a href='https://new.ras.ru/en/'>Russian Academy of Sciences<a/> Medal for Young Scientists. In 2019, I led the CDS team, which took first place in the <a href='https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2019-minerl-competition'>NeurIPS MineRL competition</a>. In 2023, I led the SkillFusion team, which secured first place in the <a href='https://aihabitat.org/challenge/2023/'>CVPR Habitat competition<a/>. I have also led completed grants from the <a href='https://www.rfbr.ru/rffi/ru/'>Russian Foundation for Basic Research</a> (RFBR) and the <a href='https://rscf.ru'>Russian Science Foundation</a> (RSF).

**Academic Service:** Since 2019, I have been an editor of the journal <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/cognitive-systems-research'>Cognitive Systems Research</a> (Elsevier). From 2015 to 2022, I was a member of the Scientific Council of the <a href='https://raai.org'>Russian Association for Artificial Intelligence</a> (RAAI). Since 2017, I have been organizing annual <a href='https://airi.net/ru/summer-school-2023/'>summer schools</a> for RAAI and AIRI. In 2021 and 2022, I organized the <a href='https://www.iglu-contest.net'>NeurIPS IGLU competition</a>. Science 2022, I am a reviewer for <a href='http://aaai.org/conference/aaai/'>AAAI 2023, 2024, 2025</a>, <a href='https://ecai2023.eu'>ECAI 2023, 2024</a>, <a href='https://ieee-iros.org'>IROS 2023, 2024</a>, <a href='https://ieee-icra.org'>ICRA 2024</a>, <a href='https://cvpr.thecvf.com'>CVPR 2024</a>, <a href='https://www.ijcai.org'>IJCAI 2024</a>, <a href='https://neurips.cc'>NeurIPS 2024</a> conferences and in <a href='https://aclrollingreview.org'>ACL Rolling Review</a> cycles.
