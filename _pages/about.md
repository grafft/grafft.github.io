Currently, I lead a group for neurosymbolic integration at the <a href='https://airi.net'>Artificial Intelligence Institute (AIRI)</a>, engage in embodied artificial intelligence at the <a href='https://cogmodel.mipt.ru'>Cognitive Modeling Center</a> of the <a href='https://mipt.ru/english/'>Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology</a>(MIPT), and work on deep reinforcement learning at the <a href='https://www.frccsc.ru'>Federal Research Center "Informatics and Control" of the Russian Academy of Sciences</a> (FRC CSC RAS). My current scientific interests are related to transformer models and structured world models in reinforcement learning, applying language models for behavior planning (including for robotics platforms), multi-agent planning and learning, and indoor visual navigation.

At AIRI, my primary focus is on fundamental research for creating new neurosymbolic architectures for planning and learning. At MIPT, I lead applied activities and oversee commissioned research in robotics and control systems. Additionally, at MIPT, I am the head of the <a href='http://rairi.ru/wiki/index.php/Магистерская_программа_МТИИ'>master's program in artificial intelligence</a>, which is one of the most sought-after non-industrial programs in the <a href='https://mipt.ru/education/departments/fpmi/'>Phystech School of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science</a> (FPMI). At FRC CSC RAS, I lead the department of "Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Research" and develop various approaches in the field of reinforcement learning.

**Brief Biography**: In 2005, I graduated from the <a href='https://sesc.nsu.ru/'>physics and mathematics school</a> at <a href='https://www.nsu.ru'>Novosibirsk State University</a> (NSU), and later pursued a bachelor's degree in the Faculty of Physics at the same university, specializing in physical-technical informatics. I completed my master's degree in applied mathematics and physics at MIPT, Department of Intelligent Systems (basic department of the Computing Center of RAS). I conducted my doctoral dissertation at the Institute for System Analysis of RAS under the guidance of G.S. Osipov (topic: "Research of methods, development of models, and algorithms for forming elements of the sign representation of the subject's world view"). Since 2019, I have been leading the Scientific and Educational Center for Cognitive Modeling at MIPT and the master's program "Methods and Technologies of Artificial Intelligence" at FPMI.

In 2017, I became a laureate of the Russian Academy of Sciences Medal for Young Scientists. In 2019, I led the CDS team, which took first place in the NeurIPS MineRL competition. In 2021 and 2022, I organized the NeurIPS IGLU competition. In 2023, I led the SkillFusion team, which secured the first place in the CVPR Habitat competition. Since 2019, I have been an editor of the journal Cognitive Systems Research (Elsevier). From 2015 to 2022, I was a member of the Scientific Council of the Russian Association for Artificial Intelligence. Since 2019, I have been organizing annual summer schools for the Russian Association for Artificial Intelligence and AIRI. I have also led successfully completed grants from the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) and the Russian Science Foundation (RSF) since 2019.
